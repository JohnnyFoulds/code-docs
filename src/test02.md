There once was a fox

- he sucked balls
- he was lazy

And he also sometimes wrote shitty code.

### Shit Code Example

```python
frogs = 1

def reward():
    global frogs
    frogs += 1
    return frogs
```

This is a piece of the stylesheet.

```css
  .content {
    font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
    font-size: 16px;
    line-height: 1.5;
    color: #333;
    margin: 00px 0;
    padding: 10px;
    background-color: #fff;
  }
```
